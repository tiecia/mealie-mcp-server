# Changelog

All notable changes to the Mealie MCP Server.

## [Unreleased]

### ✨ New Features

- `patch_recipe` now accepts `org_url` (maps to Mealie's `orgURL` field) so a
  recipe's original source link can be set/updated without a separate call.
- `patch_recipe` now accepts `image_url`, which scrapes and sets the recipe's
  image (via the same endpoint as `set_recipe_image_from_url`) as part of a
  single patch call alongside other field updates.
- `create_recipe` and `update_recipe` now accept titled/grouped instruction
  steps. Each item in `instructions` may be a plain string (unchanged,
  backward compatible) or a dict with a required `"text"` key and optional
  `"title"`/`"summary"` keys, e.g.
  `{"title": "For the crust", "text": "Mix flour, butter, and salt."}`.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### Critical Fixes
1. **Shopping List Item Update - Field Preservation**
   - **Issue:** Updating an item cleared any fields not explicitly provided in the update
   - **Fix:** Implemented fetch-merge-update pattern that preserves all existing fields
   - **Impact:** Prevents data loss when updating shopping list items

2. **Delete Operations - Empty Response Handling**
   - **Issue:** DELETE operations returning `null` or empty responses caused validation errors
   - **Fix:** Added normalization for `null` JSON responses and empty content
   - **Impact:** All delete operations now work correctly (categories, tags, shopping lists, recipes)

3. **Recipe Duplicate - Missing Request Body**
   - **Issue:** API requires JSON body but tool wasn't sending one
   - **Fix:** Always send proper JSON body (empty object or with name override)
   - **Impact:** Recipe duplication now works without errors

4. **Recipe Last Made - Missing Timestamp**
   - **Issue:** API requires timestamp field but tool sent empty object
   - **Fix:** Auto-generate current UTC timestamp if not provided
   - **Impact:** Marking recipes as made now works seamlessly

#### Documentation Improvements
- **Tag/Category Filtering Clarification**
  - Added explicit documentation that filtering requires **slugs or UUIDs**, not display names
  - Tool descriptions now include examples: `tags=["quick-meals"]` ✅ vs `tags=["Quick Meals"]` ❌
  - Prevents silent filter failures due to incorrect identifiers

### 📝 API Changes

#### New Mixin Classes
- `ShoppingListMixin` - Complete shopping list and item management
- `CategoriesMixin` - Recipe category organization
- `TagsMixin` - Recipe tag management

#### Updated Mixins
- `RecipeMixin` - Enhanced with PATCH, duplicate, delete, images, assets, and advanced filtering
